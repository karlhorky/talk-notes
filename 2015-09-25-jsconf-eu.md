# JSConf EU 2015

## [I think I know what you're talking about... but I'm not quite sure](http://jennz0r.github.com/think-know-not-sure)

- Jenn currently works for EventBrite
- creator of Human Wasteland and Developers Developers
- sometimes in conversations with other developers, it's hard to understand
  - so many different names for things and easy to confuse them (it's one of the hard things in computer science)

### Parameter vs Argument

- parameters help define a function (at function definition), arguments are passed into a function (at function call)

### Scope

- scope on wikipedia: the scope of a name binding – an association of a name to an entity, such as a variable – is the part of a computer program where the binding is valid: where the name can be used to refer to the entity
- lexical scoping: the portion of the source code in which a binding of a name with an entity applies. Virtually unchanged since ALGOL 1960.

#### Lexical vs Dynamic

- for most programming languages, "part of a program" refers to "portion of the source code (area of text)", and is known as lexical scope
- in some languages "part of a program" refers to "portion of run time (time period during execution)", and is known as dynamic scope

### Recursion

- most common definition in math or computer science
- simple definition: a function that calls itself

### Concatenation

- etymology dictionary: to link together in a chain

### Instantiate

- to represent as or by an instance
- in philosophy: Universal Instantiation: a valid rule of inference from a truth about each member of a class of individuals to the truth about a particular individual of that class

### Acronyms

- CRM: customer relationship manager
- CMS: content management system
- CDN: content delivery network
- Saas: software as a service
- Sass: syntactically awesome stylesheets
- DOM: document object module. Structured tree representation of a document
- CLI: command line interface
- GUI: graphical user interface. introduced in reaction to steep learning curve of CLIs
- AJAX: asynchronous javascript and xml. Outdated - most APIs use JSON

### What to do

- help each other out

## [How the browser actually renders a website](https://speakerdeck.com/ryanseddon/how-the-browser-actually-renders-a-website)

by [Ryan Seddon](https://twitter.com/ryanseddon)

- Ryan works at Zendesk
- 30,000 ft view

### High level view

- browser one of the most complex applications ever
  - bindings (talking to network, etc)
  - rendering: (parsing, layout, painting)
  - platform (windows, osx, linux specific stuff)
  - JavaScript VM
- we're covering the rendering part
- flow: parse html + parse css => render tree => layout => paint

### In-depth view

#### parsing html

- HTML is forgiving by nature
  - xhtml strict wasn't
- parsing isn't straightforward
- can be halted
- will do speculative parsing
  - will look ahead for images, scripts, css to fetch
- it's reentrant
- script link and style tags will halt parser as script can alter the document
  - network latency
  - this is why you add scripts at the bottom of the document (faster to render, parsing uninterrupted)
    - can alternately do this with defer or async attributes

#### DOM and CSSOM

- not a 1 to 1 mapping of your html (multiple trees)
  - RenderObjects
    - visual output
    - geometric info
    - can layout and paint
    - style and computed metrics
  - RenderStyles
  - RenderLayers
    - creates layers from RenderObjects
    - positions nodes, transparency, overflow, canvas, video
  - line boxes - will change if element needs to reflow to next line
- not in render tree: hidden nodes

#### Layout

- recursive process
  - traverses render tree
  - positions and sizes nodes
  - layouts its children
- will batch layouts
  - intelligent change batching
  - render tree items will flag selves as dirty and these will be collected later to be processed
  - async
- certain things will cause immediate layout
  - font sizing
  - accessing props like width and height

### Performance insights

- take notes from browser
  - bad: read then write, read then write
  - good: read, read, write
  - real world: FastDom: preventing layout thrashing
  - most modern JS frameworks do this internally
- painting: bitmap uploaded to GPU and composited
- inline critical CSS: speeds up first paint times
  - browser can make a delta from last bitmap

## What I learned teaching programming to 150 beginners

by [Etiene da Cruz Dalcol](https://twitter.com/etiene_d)

- did [a workshop](https://github.com/Etiene/jsduckhunt) for JavaScript for 150 people for 2 hours
  - variables
  - arrays
  - loops
  - fuctions
  - operators
  - conditions

### Beginners

- for beginners it's really tough when code doesn't work due to small mistakes like indentation or missed brackets or something
- JS - we can use a subset of the language to make things easier for the beginners
- Lua a bit obscure
- Tooling for JS good as well
  - Mozilla Thimble
- 0 effort
- no additional libraries
- easy to visualize
- easy to remember

### Teaching Tips

- have everything ready
- skeleton code is very useful
- use an easy url
- set a time limit and then give out the answers
- cover the main lessons first, and leave the extras for the end
- typography: be careful that the characters in the typography are easily recognizable
- inspiring your students is important
  - show examples of things they can build
  - showing people having fun with things they built
- reserve some time in your work to teach others

## Dependency Hell

by [Stephan Bönnemann](https://twitter.com/boennemann)

- ability to set dependencies is a very positive thing, but it can create difficulties

### Positives

- to upgrade your productivity, just look for and use packages with npm search
  - instead of writing your own code
- don't need a deep understanding of something to learn - just give them tools and resources to build things - they will learn through building
- the inertia and richness of the community creates huge productivity gains for everyone

### Difficulties

- often developers will say: small modules are only good in theory
  - breakage can occur in a lot more places
- this leads to negativity: npm sucks, modules suck
- we may be getting functionality and producitivity for free, but we still need to write tests for our softare's functionality
- you are in the dependency hell because of your own sins (not testing your functionality)

### What do we do?

- humans should human
- computers should computer
- computers only exist so we can better human
- so Stephan built some tools
  - semantic-release
  - [greenkeeper](http://greenkeeper.io)
    - open PRs for pinned-down versions
    - easy to see which package and version caused a particular problem

## The illusion of time

by [Denys Mishunov](https://twitter.com/mishunov)

- Benjamin Franklin in 1742: remember that time is money
- 1s vs 3s: -50% bounce rate
- 2.2 second improvement in load speed: +10M/year Firefox downloads

### Psychology

- users don't care about absolute numbers and statistics though
  - performance isn't just about statistics
  - it's about the user's perception
- that the user notices doesn't mean that it is meaningful for us as web developers
- active phase: brain is actively engaging in activity
- passive phase: brain is just waiting for things to be over
  - overestimation of waiting time by 36%
  - people hate passive phase waiting

### What can we do

- we can reduce the passive phase by doing magic during the required waiting time (to trigger the active phase) - animations, CSS, interactive elements, etc
- example: at an airport, many complaints came in regarding baggage waits
  - they tried first with more baggage handlers
  - the solution: routing the plane further away from the baggage carousel (longer traveling time for the passengers from the plane)
    - this meant less passive phase just standing and waiting around for the bags
- we can do this in our web applications by:
  - shifting the perception of when the page or content looks finished to earlier than normal
  - offering interactivity or animations during loading or processing time
- example: problems with skyscrapers: complaints with waiting for elevators
  - no technical solutions available
  - solution: mirrors in the lobbies - people were checking themselves out
    - complaints dropped to zero
- modern frontend developers should always consider performance:
  - not just as engineers, but also as:
  - technicians
  - psychologists
  - magicians
