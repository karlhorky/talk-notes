# JSConf EU 2015

## [I think I know what you're talking about... but I'm not quite sure](http://jennz0r.github.com/think-know-not-sure)

- Jenn currently works for EventBrite
- creator of Human Wasteland and Developers Developers
- sometimes in conversations with other developers, it's hard to understand
  - so many different names for things and easy to confuse them (it's one of the hard things in computer science)

### Parameter vs Argument

- parameters help define a function (at function definition), arguments are passed into a function (at function call)

### Scope

- scope on wikipedia: the scope of a name binding – an association of a name to an entity, such as a variable – is the part of a computer program where the binding is valid: where the name can be used to refer to the entity
- lexical scoping: the portion of the source code in which a binding of a name with an entity applies. Virtually unchanged since ALGOL 1960.

#### Lexical vs Dynamic

- for most programming languages, "part of a program" refers to "portion of the source code (area of text)", and is known as lexical scope
- in some languages "part of a program" refers to "portion of run time (time period during execution)", and is known as dynamic scope

### Recursion

- most common definition in math or computer science
- simple definition: a function that calls itself

### Concatenation

- etymology dictionary: to link together in a chain

### Instantiate

- to represent as or by an instance
- in philosophy: Universal Instantiation: a valid rule of inference from a truth about each member of a class of individuals to the truth about a particular individual of that class

### Acronyms

- CRM: customer relationship manager
- CMS: content management system
- CDN: content delivery network
- Saas: software as a service
- Sass: syntactically awesome stylesheets
- DOM: document object module. Structured tree representation of a document
- CLI: command line interface
- GUI: graphical user interface. introduced in reaction to steep learning curve of CLIs
- AJAX: asynchronous javascript and xml. Outdated - most APIs use JSON

### What to do

- help each other out

## [How the browser actually renders a website](https://speakerdeck.com/ryanseddon/how-the-browser-actually-renders-a-website)

by [Ryan Seddon](https://twitter.com/ryanseddon)

- Ryan works at Zendesk
- 30,000 ft view

### High level view

- browser one of the most complex applications ever
  - bindings (talking to network, etc)
  - rendering: (parsing, layout, painting)
  - platform (windows, osx, linux specific stuff)
  - JavaScript VM
- we're covering the rendering part
- flow: parse html + parse css => render tree => layout => paint

### In-depth view

#### parsing html

- HTML is forgiving by nature
  - xhtml strict wasn't
- parsing isn't straightforward
- can be halted
- will do speculative parsing
  - will look ahead for images, scripts, css to fetch
- it's reentrant
- script link and style tags will halt parser as script can alter the document
  - network latency
  - this is why you add scripts at the bottom of the document (faster to render, parsing uninterrupted)
    - can alternately do this with defer or async attributes

#### DOM and CSSOM

- not a 1 to 1 mapping of your html (multiple trees)
  - RenderObjects
    - visual output
    - geometric info
    - can layout and paint
    - style and computed metrics
  - RenderStyles
  - RenderLayers
    - creates layers from RenderObjects
    - positions nodes, transparency, overflow, canvas, video
  - line boxes - will change if element needs to reflow to next line
- not in render tree: hidden nodes

#### Layout

- recursive process
  - traverses render tree
  - positions and sizes nodes
  - layouts its children
- will batch layouts
  - intelligent change batching
  - render tree items will flag selves as dirty and these will be collected later to be processed
  - async
- certain things will cause immediate layout
  - font sizing
  - accessing props like width and height

### Performance insights

- take notes from browser
  - bad: read then write, read then write
  - good: read, read, write
  - real world: FastDom: preventing layout thrashing
  - most modern JS frameworks do this internally
- painting: bitmap uploaded to GPU and composited
- inline critical CSS: speeds up first paint times
  - browser can make a delta from last bitmap

## What I learned teaching programming to 150 beginners

by [Etiene da Cruz Dalcol](https://twitter.com/etiene_d)

- did [a workshop](https://github.com/Etiene/jsduckhunt) for JavaScript for 150 people for 2 hours
  - variables
  - arrays
  - loops
  - fuctions
  - operators
  - conditions

### Beginners

- for beginners it's really tough when code doesn't work due to small mistakes like indentation or missed brackets or something
- JS - we can use a subset of the language to make things easier for the beginners
- Lua a bit obscure
- Tooling for JS good as well
  - Mozilla Thimble
- 0 effort
- no additional libraries
- easy to visualize
- easy to remember

### Teaching Tips

- have everything ready
- skeleton code is very useful
- use an easy url
- set a time limit and then give out the answers
- cover the main lessons first, and leave the extras for the end
- typography: be careful that the characters in the typography are easily recognizable
- inspiring your students is important
  - show examples of things they can build
  - showing people having fun with things they built
- reserve some time in your work to teach others

## Dependency Hell

by [Stephan Bönnemann](https://twitter.com/boennemann)

- ability to set dependencies is a very positive thing, but it can create difficulties

### Positives

- to upgrade your productivity, just look for and use packages with npm search
  - instead of writing your own code
- don't need a deep understanding of something to learn - just give them tools and resources to build things - they will learn through building
- the inertia and richness of the community creates huge productivity gains for everyone

### Difficulties

- often developers will say: small modules are only good in theory
  - breakage can occur in a lot more places
- this leads to negativity: npm sucks, modules suck
- we may be getting functionality and producitivity for free, but we still need to write tests for our softare's functionality
- you are in the dependency hell because of your own sins (not testing your functionality)

### What do we do?

- humans should human
- computers should computer
- computers only exist so we can better human
- so Stephan built some tools
  - semantic-release
  - [greenkeeper](http://greenkeeper.io)
    - open PRs for pinned-down versions
    - easy to see which package and version caused a particular problem

## The illusion of time

by [Denys Mishunov](https://twitter.com/mishunov)

- Benjamin Franklin in 1742: remember that time is money
- 1s vs 3s: -50% bounce rate
- 2.2 second improvement in load speed: +10M/year Firefox downloads

### Psychology

- users don't care about absolute numbers and statistics though
  - performance isn't just about statistics
  - it's about the user's perception
- that the user notices doesn't mean that it is meaningful for us as web developers
- active phase: brain is actively engaging in activity
- passive phase: brain is just waiting for things to be over
  - overestimation of waiting time by 36%
  - people hate passive phase waiting

### What can we do

- we can reduce the passive phase by doing magic during the required waiting time (to trigger the active phase) - animations, CSS, interactive elements, etc
- example: at an airport, many complaints came in regarding baggage waits
  - they tried first with more baggage handlers
  - the solution: routing the plane further away from the baggage carousel (longer traveling time for the passengers from the plane)
    - this meant less passive phase just standing and waiting around for the bags
- we can do this in our web applications by:
  - shifting the perception of when the page or content looks finished to earlier than normal
  - offering interactivity or animations during loading or processing time
- example: problems with skyscrapers: complaints with waiting for elevators
  - no technical solutions available
  - solution: mirrors in the lobbies - people were checking themselves out
    - complaints dropped to zero
- modern frontend developers should always consider performance:
  - not just as engineers, but also as:
  - technicians
  - psychologists
  - magicians

## Transpiling Recomposed

by [Peter Müller](https://twitter.com/_munter_)

- made AssetGraph
- transpiling: source to source (one language to another)
- problem is not with transpilers themselves
- problem is with the build systems and side effects
- primary problem is the build artifact
- build artifacts are transient
- build artifacts aren't to be stored (excluded through gitignore)
  - this causes problems when serving the files - then the server needs to know about the build artifacts and locations
- normally you take a task runner for this
  - and then packages for
    - linters
    - cache invalidation
    - deployment
  - this leads to complexity
- you don't need complexity - you need ability

### Important aspects of transpilation

- handles all types of transpilers ★ ♞ ☢
- good API ☢
- easy integration ☢
- standalone, no ecosystem imposed ☢
- on demand transpilation ♞ ☢
- keep urls valid ♞ ☢
- be nice: ★ ♞ ☢
  - sourcemaps
  - autoprefixing
  - caching
- no configuration ♞ ☢
- simple mental model ♞ ☢

★ task runners check these ones off

♞ express middleware

☢ fusile

### Fusile

- mounts filesystem using Fuse
- simple command line tool that runs and transcompiles on demand

## The power of small abstractions

by [Josep M. Bach](https://twitter.com/txustice)

- abstraction: our brain does this all the time
  - being able to tell that two different-looking animals are both dogs
  - forgetting their differences to understand the essence of them
- in philosophy, identity is an unsolved problem
  - is the same person ten years later actually the same person?
- monoids: things that have a single associative binary operation and an identity element
- functors: things that can have functions mapped over them
- monads: thing to be able to flatten nested functors (functors that return functors)

## The Mobile Web is a Contender

by [Surma Surma](https://twitter.com/surmair)

- article: "native / mobile web app war over: native won!"
  - mobile web apps are just getting the native-competitive features now
  - the statistics are from a study in 2013
  - if you look carefully at the statistics, the amount of time spent on web-type content in native apps and mobile web apps are about the same
  - John Gruber: "native apps can't out-web the web"

### Native-like Mobile Web Features

- add to homescreen
- offline web apps
- background loading for slow connections
- push notifications

## Some Things I’ve Learned About Color

by [Cate Huston](https://twitter.com/catehstn)

### Causes of burnout

- lack of control
- insufficient reward
- lack of community
- absence of fairness
- conflict in values
- work overload

### What can we do?

- side projects can help (except for #6)
  - side projects are things that you do for love, not money
- don't just try to cut out leisure time
- say no to thankless emotional labour
- if you use the time when you're on top of your game the best, you can accomplish a lot more with less overall working time
- @amygdalama: "I like referring to myself as 'my human', as in 'my human is frustrated', or 'my human has certain needs'"

## If Walter Gropius was a JavaScripter

by [Whitney Williams](https://twitter.com/whitneyhacks)

- for many people Bauhaus associated with particular aesthetic
- this talk about the way of thinking
- industrialization of 19th century brought about huge chages
  - factories starting to mass produce
  - started in 1880s
  - but very bad quality
  - when things broke, you just threw it away
  - arts and crafts community came along, and they wanted to make quality things
  - factory-made goods could not reproduce
- Walter Gropius
  - tried to shape a new kind of designer and human being that could change the world
  - principles: experiment, collaborate, synthesize, learn
  - "The first task was to liberate the pupil's individuality from the dead weight of conventions and allow him to acquire that personal experience and self-taught knowledge"
  - don't copy the old masters' works
  - let's learn form, colour, composition and create something new
  - by 1923, walter started to shift his ideas
    - more intense collaboration with technology
    - the leadership was shifted away from him
  - sought to eliminate the gap between the artist and the ordinary person
  - "The final goal of all artistic activity is architecture"

### how have the Bauhaus ideas stood the test of time? what can we learn from it?

- our programming community has lost our way:
  - very insular
  - designer / developer split harmful
    - they should be working together
- bauhaus incredibly progressive for its time
- bauhaus: marrying applied and fine arts
- for programming community: we must reconcile code with design
  - we should move away from tiny circles
  - inclusivity
- bauhaus had the idea of embracing change and new technology
- being revolutionary means taking risks
  - need to always learning
  - need to always keep churning out work
- our industry can change the world for the better
- prioritize partnerships over the individual
  - balancing personal praise with working together
- we should establish a set of guiding principles for the community
  - the way that we work with people
- the web is our Gesamtkunstwerk

### how do we avoid burnout as a result of this constant progress?

- progress, not perfection is our goal

## The Risks and Rewards of Getting Involved and How to Do It

by [Bryan Hughes](https://twitter.com/nebrius)

- Bryan: frontend dev at Rdio
- 9-5 is not all that there is for devs:
  - conferences
  - open-source projects
  - etc
- just put yourself out there and try things (try putting together a talk for a conference, open a pull request for an open-source project)
  - you may get rejected the first few times
  - don't get discouraged
  - to minimize rejection, start small - small PRs, small proposals
  - you don't need to be an expert on a topic to speak about it at a conference
- we tend to put "experts" on a pedestal
  - because they are knowledgeable on one small thing
  - they are just regular people
- people don't just help us get into a community - they help us to stay as well
  - communities are all about people

- impostor syndrome: where someone feels like an impostor or fraud because they think that their accomplishments are nowhere near as good as those of the people around them

### How to get involved

- commit to your motivation
- reach out to others already doing something

### Diversity

- Bryan: grew up in Texas, and thought that San Francisco was more "enlightened" in comparison
- however, the tech industry industry has problems:
  - misogynistic
  - bigotry
  - homophobia
  - racism
  - non-safe working environment for LGBT
- our industry fundamentally broken
- we are all complicit if we are not actively working against the status quo
- not to stand against the problems in the tech community is to make it worse
- making mistakes is okay, we're human
- not learning from the mistakes causes real harm
- people get and stay involved, leave or join a community based on how comfortable they are with being themselves
- cultivate a basic understanding of people not like you

## What Your Scanner Doesn’t Tell You CAN Hurt You

by [Anand Vemuri](https://twitter.com/brownhat57)

- Anand: software dev that later became security consultant
- word software dev is very descriptive of what they actually do
- no word really defines what exactly security consultants do
  - sometimes used: scanner
  - scanner - a person or a thing that scans
  - scan - to glance over or look at hastily
  - when you're "scanning", you have a very good chance that you'll miss something
  - however, the jobs of security consultants is much deeper
    - examining every level of the application for security issues
- looking at client-side attacks lately
- major vuln in client-side: XSS
  - attacks users
  - "JavaScript injection" attack
  - exploits can be really scary
- what is XSS? (typical reflected XSS attack)
  - bad guy sends URL containing a hidden script
  - victim follows url
  - server serves pages containing script
  - browser executes malicious script
- but XSS is very deep, many flavors
  - stored XSS: every time a stored resource (like a blog comment) is accessed, the payload is delivered
  - DOM XSS

### Example: client app: Java on server, backbone on client-side

- mitigations already done:
  - sql injection
  - etc
- asked about XSS. "Oh you mean that popup thing? oh yeah, we're good."
  - very surprising response
- so Anand ran it through
  - scan.js
  - jsprime - static analyser
  - everything
- tool for bootstrapping the attack in the browser when a XSS vulnerability exists: BeEF (browser exploitation framework project)
  - creates a hook to hook the browser
  - shows user details
  - execute predefined exploits

### Are we all just screwed?

- Contextual Output Escaping is still a thing
- Content Security Policy
  - specify which scripts for the browser to load
  - is large enough that it's a topic in its own
- full-stack vulnerable JS app: https://github.com/relotnek/medcellar

### Sum up

- scanners don't work, especially when it comes to frameworks
